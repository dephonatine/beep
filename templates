Template: beep/suid_option
Type: select
__Choices: usable for all, usable for group audio, usable only for root
Default: suid root with only group audio executable
_Description: Install beep as:
 beep must be run as root since it needs to access the speaker hardware.
 There are several possibilities to make the program usable:  Either only
 for root (no suid bit at all), executable only by users of the group
 audio, or usable for all.
 .
 Since each program set as suid root can be a security risk this is not done
 by default.  However, the program is quite small (~150 lines of code), so it
 is fairly easy to verify the safety of the code yourself, if you don't
 trust the package maintainer's judgement.
